##Mapping Data 

With this exercise, you will learn introductory skills involved in using ArcGIS to map existing spatial datasets. After the completion of this set of exercises, you should have…

1. become familiar with the QGIS user interface 
2. learned the components of shapefiles 
3. created a clear and effective map composition 
4. critically considered symbology and classification and the differences between mapping qualitative and quantitative information 
5. created and calculated new fields in an attribute table 
6. performed a table join to combine additional data to an existing shapefile’s attribute table 
7. queried a GIS dataset, using both tabular queries and spatial queries 
8. accessed the metadata of an existing GIS dataset
9. worked with projections and examined the impacts of projection transformations on spatial analysis

Part 00
Download the GitHub repository for this course. The Class_Data folder will then have all of the datasets needed for tutorials. 

###Mapping Data 00: Mapping World Population(s)
####Premise
We are interested in creating a map of world countries and cities (and at the same time exploring the QGIS interface). We have a point file for the locations of populated places around the world as well as a polygon file for country boundaries. This map will serve as a basemap to which we can add additional information and layers in order to examine multiple measures of population and the differences between them.
####Setting up QGIS
Launch QGIS. Your new blank map project will look like this:

Begin to familiarize yourself with the interface.
