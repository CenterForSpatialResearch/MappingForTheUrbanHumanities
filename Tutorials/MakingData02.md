## Making Data 02

### Digitizing Exercise

In this exercise you will take the Bronx map sheet you georeferenced in the earlier exercise and use it to digitize features from the map.  In essence, you will be converting raster spatial data into vector based features. 

Open QGIS:

Click on the add raster button ![DigitizingExercise](https://github.com/CenterForSpatialResearch/MappingForTheUrbanHumanities/blob/master/Tutorials/Images/MakingData01/Digitize2.png) and navigate to the georeferenced image you made in the georeferencing workshop.  Since you verified its accuracy already, you will not need any basemap data for this exercise:

This map is part of a very large-scale plan and the Bronx park area, which contains the then-new botanical garden and zoo, are particularly detailed.  Every structure, road, walking path, and tree is mapped.  In the next part of this exercise, you will create new vector datasets, and hand-digitize some of the path and tree features.

First you will digitize some trees.  For the trees you will use point geometry, so this will be a particularly simple dataset.

Remove any transparency from the georeferenced map layer. Zoom into the southwest corner of Bronx Park, where the Conservatory garden and library (labeled ‘museum’ on the map) are:

Next you will create a new point layer.  Under the layer menu, choose create new layer and new shapefile layer:

 In the new vector dialog layer, choose type “Point”.  You can also create additional attribute fields for your dataset, if applicable.  Here, I have added a tree “type” attribute and made it a text field with a maximum length of 80.  Select OK:

Save the new file in the same directory with your map, and name it BronxParkTrees.

 The layer will now appear in the Layers panel:

Now begin editing by depressing the toggle editing tool ![DigitizingExercise](https://github.com/CenterForSpatialResearch/MappingForTheUrbanHumanities/blob/master/Tutorials/Images/MakingData01/Digitize9.png) while the trees layer is highlighted in the layers panel.  Now you can use the add feature tool ![DigitizingExercise](https://github.com/CenterForSpatialResearch/MappingForTheUrbanHumanities/blob/master/Tutorials/Images/MakingData01/Digitize10.png) to start creating trees.  Click on one of the trees in the map.  An attribute dialog appears where you can type in attribute information for the feature you just created.
