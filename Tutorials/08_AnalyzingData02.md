### Analyzing Data 02: Classifications of the Urban and Raster Operations
#### Premise

What is the effective reach of the New York City urban area? We will use a raster dataset from the National Land Cover Database to look at the extents of NYC urban area and compare it to other definitions of the effective boundaries of New York City. In addition, the land cover data will help us to become familiarized with the qualities of raster data as well as raster calculations.

#### Research Questions
* What is the effective reach of the New York City urban area in terms of economics? 
* What is the physical geography of New York City’s most densely built zones? 
* How do these two geographies relate to one another?
 
#### About the Data
The National Land Cover Database is a raster dataset that describes the land cover (or the physical material at the surface of the earth such as Deciduous Forest, Developed High Intensity, or Cultivated Crops) of the United States. Land cover data is generated by analyzing remotely sensed data collected by Landsat satellites and thus like Landsat satellite images it has a resolution of 30 meters. [This article](http://landcover.usgs.gov/pdf/anderson.pdf) contains more information on the kinds of methodologies used to create this dataset.    
We have cropped the National Land Cover Database to just the area near New York City for the purposes of this tutorial, however the full U.S. dataset is available for download [here]( http://www.mrlc.gov/nlcd11_data.php)

Similar datasets are available for other parts of the globe, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Land Cover Institute keeps a catalog of [global land cover data sources]( http://landcover.usgs.gov/landcoverdata.php). Land cover data is generated by analyzing remotely sensed data collected by Landsat satellites. [This article](http://landcover.usgs.gov/pdf/anderson.pdf) contains more information on the kinds of methodologies used to create this dataset.    

We are also using two different boundaries for New York City’s effective reach as an urban area. These are the combined statistical area (CSA), and the core based statistical area (CBSA). These boundaries are neither administrative ones nor do they necessarily correspond to natural geographies. Instead they are boundaries that have been generated by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in order to describe relationships between urban centers and their surrounding areas – in a sense they are one way that the U.S. measures the relationship between the city and its hinterland. Specifically, CBSAs, which is a category that includes Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA), are defined as the counties surrounding a city of at least 10,000 people which have strong economic and social ties with that urban center. CSAs are slightly larger geographies which are comprised of multiple adjacent CBSAs which are tied through employment. 

Further descriptions are available [here](https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/gtc/gtc_cbsa.html). We have provided you with two layers containing the CSA and CBSA boundaries just for New York however the original data for the whole U.S. is available [here](https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-line.html).

#### Before you begin
If you haven't already, download the GitHub repository for this course. Using the green button [here](https://github.com/CenterForSpatialResearch/MappingForTheUrbanHumanities), select `Download ZIP`. The Class_Data folder will then have all of the datasets needed for tutorials. 

#### New Downloads
Download the land cover data clipped to the New York City area [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B5KywkNXsT4JdXZjOXV1SE1wWjg).

Create a new folder within Class_Data\3_AnalyzingData called `Raster` and save the `NLCD_NewYork_2011.tif` file there.

#### Setting up QGIS
Launch QGIS and open a new map project. Use the `add vector layer` tool and navigate to Class_Data\3_AnalyzingData and add:
* 2011_CSA_NY
* 2011_CBSA_NY

![layers](https://github.com/CenterForSpatialResearch/MappingForTheUrbanHumanities/blob/master/Tutorials/Images/AnalyzingData02/01.png)

Then use the `add raster layer` tool and navigate to the new folder you’ve just made and add:
* NLCD_NewYork_2011.tif

![layers](https://github.com/CenterForSpatialResearch/MappingForTheUrbanHumanities/blob/master/Tutorials/Images/AnalyzingData02/02.png)

#### Analyzing Raster Data

First we will examine the way that the land cover data is classified. 

To do this open the layer properties of the land cover data layer. Under the style tab you’ll notice that the `Render type` is Paletted and that each value in the raster dataset is given a discrete color. However the colors only are applied to certain numeric values. This is because the classifications in the land cover dataset are [encoded](http://www.mrlc.gov/nlcd11_leg.php) through numeric values which describe the land cover type in each 30m by 30m grid cell. 

![rasterstyle](https://github.com/CenterForSpatialResearch/MappingForTheUrbanHumanities/blob/master/Tutorials/Images/AnalyzingData02/03.png)

The land cover classifications to which these numbers refer are as follows:

* 11. Open Water
* 12. Perennial Ice Snow
* 21. Developed, Open Space
* 22. Developed, Low Intensity
* 23. Developed, Medium Intensity
* 24. Developed High Intensity
* 31. Bare Rock/Sand/Clay
* 41. Deciduous Forest
* 42. Evergreen Forest
* 43. Mixed Forest
* 51. Dwarf Shrub
* 52. Shrub/Scrub
* 71. Grasslands/Herbaceous
* 72. Sedge/Herbaceous
* 74. Moss
* 81. Pasture/Hay
* 82. Cultivated Crops
* 90. Woody Wetlands
* 95. Emergent Herbaceous Wetlands

Given that we are interested in isolating the densely built zones in the New York City area we are primarily interested in the ‘Developed’ classifications. These describe areas of the globe that are covered with ‘constructed materials’ (in contrast to vegetation) and the degree of intensity of each classification type corresponds with how much of the land area in a given 30m by 30m cell is covered with constructed materials. 
Lets review our core research question: what is the physical geography of New York City’s most densely built zones? 

We will define ‘densly built zones’ for the purposes of this analysis as zones in the `Developed` land cover categories.

Thus, in order to answer this question, we will isolate the ‘Developed’ land cover areas and export them to a new raster file. This will allow us to more easily compare these areas with the economic zones defined by the OMB (it will also give us a chance introduce how to use the raster calculator).

In order to isolate the ‘Developed’ areas we will construct an expression in the raster calculator. To open the raster calculator navigate to `Raster`>`Raster Calculator…`
The outputs of any calculations performed in the raster calculator will be exported as new raster data layers. Thus we need to specify an output layer, we will name this `NLCD_NewYork2011_Urban` and save it in the 3_AnalyzingData/Process folder. 
Double click on the name of the land cover layer in the Raster bands box and use the operators to construct the following expression: `"NLCD_NewYork_2011@1" = 21 OR "NLCD_NewYork_2011@1" = 22 OR "NLCD_NewYork_2011@1" = 23 OR "NLCD_NewYork_2011@1" = 24`

Click `OK`.

The result will be added to your map project and will look like this: 

![calc](https://github.com/CenterForSpatialResearch/MappingForTheUrbanHumanities/blob/master/Tutorials/Images/AnalyzingData02/05.png)

We can consider this new raster layer to describe one boundary of New York --  the zones of highly developed land.
Again we will return to our research questions:
How does the geography of New York’s `developed` land in the land cover data base compare with the economic boundaries of New York City as defined by the OMB? 

To answer this we can compare this new raster data layer with the two economic urban boundaries we first added into our map project. This will be a purely visual comparison. 

Symbolize these three datasets in a manner which will allow you to make comparisons between them.

What can we say about the relationship between these three modes of defining the urban area of New York City?
