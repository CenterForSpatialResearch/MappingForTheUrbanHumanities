###Analyzing Data 03: Schools, Libraries and Raster Analysis

###Premise
We will return to the analysis of schools and libraries we were conducting in Part One of this exercise however now we will now use raster analysis tools to answer similar questions through slightly different means and for the entirely of New York City. We want to know which parts of New York City have the greatest access to schools and libraries. Weâ€™ll answer this using a raster-based decision map.
