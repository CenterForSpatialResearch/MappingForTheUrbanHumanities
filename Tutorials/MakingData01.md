##Making Data

###Georeferencing Exercise

In this exercise, you will explore some of the georeferencing tools available in QGIS and use then to georeference a 1902 map of the Bronx.   

Open QGIS:

You are going to use OpenStreetMap (OSM) as reference data for the georeferencing process.  OSM provides a free, open-source map of the world from public domain and volunteered data.   You can view the OSM basemap service is QGIS through the OpenLayers plugin.  This plugin does not come pre-installed with QGIS, so you will probably need to add it.  Under the plugins menu, select “Manage and Install Plugins…”

The plugins dialog will open.  Search for “Openlayers Plugin.”  Highlight it, and click “Install plugin”:

It may take a few seconds to install.  Close the plugins menu when finished.  The OpenLayers tools should now appear under the Web menu:
