##Making Data

###Georeferencing Exercise

In this exercise, you will explore some of the georeferencing tools available in QGIS and use then to georeference a 1902 map of the Bronx.   

Open QGIS:

You are going to use OpenStreetMap (OSM) as reference data for the georeferencing process.  OSM provides a free, open-source map of the world from public domain and volunteered data.   You can view the OSM basemap service is QGIS through the OpenLayers plugin.  This plugin does not come pre-installed with QGIS, so you will probably need to add it.  Under the plugins menu, select “Manage and Install Plugins…” 
![blank](https://github.com/CenterForSpatialResearch/MappingForTheUrbanHumanities/blob/master/Tutorials/Images/MakingData01/GeoRef2.png)

The plugins dialog will open.  Search for “Openlayers Plugin.”  Highlight it, and click “Install plugin”:

It may take a few seconds to install.  Close the plugins menu when finished.  The OpenLayers tools should now appear under the Web menu:

This plugin will allow you to view a number of basemap services and steam them directly into your QGIS workspace.  Choose the OpenStreetMap>OpenStreetMap option.
Since you are working in a new QGIS project, the map should show the entire earth as the default:

Use the zoom in tool ![blank](https://github.com/CenterForSpatialResearch/MappingForTheUrbanHumanities/blob/master/Tutorials/Images/MakingData01/GeoRef6.png) and zoom into the Central Bronx in the area around The Botanical Garden:
![blank](https://github.com/CenterForSpatialResearch/MappingForTheUrbanHumanities/blob/master/Tutorials/Images/MakingData01/GeoRef7.png)
Now you will access the georeferencing tools and match the scanned map to the OSM map.  

Under the Raster menu, select Georeferencer>Georeferencer:
![blank](https://github.com/CenterForSpatialResearch/MappingForTheUrbanHumanities/blob/master/Tutorials/Images/MakingData01/GeoRef8.png)

The Georeferencer screen will open:

Click on the Add Raster button ![blank](https://github.com/CenterForSpatialResearch/MappingForTheUrbanHumanities/blob/master/Tutorials/Images/MakingData01/GeoRef10a.png) and navigate to the image file in the working directory and open it.  It will appear in the georeferencer window:

This map is one sheet of six of a map of the East Bronx in 1902.  If you would like to see the entire map, there is another copy (in a lower resolution) in the New York Public Libraries digital collections [here] (http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/dc910ee0-4682-0131-4759-58d385a7bbd0)

This section represents the area around the New York Botanical Garden and the (just opened) Bronx Zoo. Fordham University can be seen just to the southwest of the garden and the Norwood neighborhood is in the northeast corner.  The area to the east of the Bronx Park area is still largely undeveloped at this point.  

Historical maps can be difficult to georeference, and this sheet poses a number of complications.  The map projection is unclear and there are no ground control points or coordinates specified.  Because of this, you will georeference by matching physical features represented on the map with their current counterparts (and their known coordinates).  However, most of the features in this map have changed or no longer exist (or were never actually built in the first place).  Thus, you will need to be very careful to choose locations that you are confident match up well with their contemporary counterparts.   Fortunately, there are a number of good candidates, particularly on the western half of the map where many streets and buildings still exist in the same location.  You will use those to georeferenced the map.

The QGIS georeferencer does not allow you to view both the scanned map and the workspace at the same time, so you will have to inspect both maps in turn and choose carefully to select locations to add georeferencing control points. 
One candidate is the Haupt Conservatory in the Botanical Garden which continues to exist largely its original configuration.  Using the georeferencer zoom tools ![blank](https://github.com/CenterForSpatialResearch/MappingForTheUrbanHumanities/blob/master/Tutorials/Images/MakingData01/GeoRef11.png) to zoom to the conservatory structure in the southwest corner of the park: ![blank](https://github.com/CenterForSpatialResearch/MappingForTheUrbanHumanities/blob/master/Tutorials/Images/MakingData01/GeoRef12.png)
![blank](https://github.com/CenterForSpatialResearch/MappingForTheUrbanHumanities/blob/master/Tutorials/Images/MakingData01/GeoRef13.png)
 
Identify as precise a location as possible (a corner of the building will work nicely) and click on it in the georeferencing window using the add point tool ![blank](https://github.com/CenterForSpatialResearch/MappingForTheUrbanHumanities/blob/master/Tutorials/Images/MakingData01/GeoRef17.png) When you do so, the Enter map coordinates window appears:
![blank](https://github.com/CenterForSpatialResearch/MappingForTheUrbanHumanities/blob/master/Tutorials/Images/MakingData01/GeoRef14.png)

If you knew the coordinates of this location, you could now add them manually, but since you do not, you must select them from the OSM data in the main QGIS window.  Click on the ![blank](https://github.com/CenterForSpatialResearch/MappingForTheUrbanHumanities/blob/master/Tutorials/Images/MakingData01/GeoRef15.png) button to see the QGIS workspace.  
You may want to use the QGIS zoom tools to zoom in very closely to the conservatory.

Once you do so, you will need to reactivate the add button tool ![blank](https://github.com/CenterForSpatialResearch/MappingForTheUrbanHumanities/blob/master/Tutorials/Images/MakingData01/GeoRef17.png) by maximizing the georeferencing window and clicking the ![blank](https://github.com/CenterForSpatialResearch/MappingForTheUrbanHumanities/blob/master/Tutorials/Images/MakingData01/GeoRef18.png) button again.  Once you select the same location on the workspace window, you will automatically be brought back to the georeferencing window where the assigned coordinates will be imputed.  
![blank](https://github.com/CenterForSpatialResearch/MappingForTheUrbanHumanities/blob/master/Tutorials/Images/MakingData01/GeoRef19.png)

At this point, if you are dissatisfied, you can move the assigned control points with the move GCP point tool ![blank](https://github.com/CenterForSpatialResearch/MappingForTheUrbanHumanities/blob/master/Tutorials/Images/MakingData01/GeoRef20.png) or delete it entirely and start over with the delete point tool ![blank](https://github.com/CenterForSpatialResearch/MappingForTheUrbanHumanities/blob/master/Tutorials/Images/MakingData01/GeoRef21.png) 
If satisfied, click the OK button and the point will be assigned and appear on the map.  Also, a link table entry will be generated on the bottom of the window:
![blank](https://github.com/CenterForSpatialResearch/MappingForTheUrbanHumanities/blob/master/Tutorials/Images/MakingData01/GeoRef22.png)

To add a second point, repeat the same process.  It is a good idea to choose another point in a different portion of the map.  A street intersection or corner from the western portion of the map will work well for this as most of those streets continue to exist in the same configuration.  
Here, I have zoomed in to the northwestern most potion of the map where I add a ground control point at the very center of the intersection of Gun Hill Road and Tryon Ave:
![blank](https://github.com/CenterForSpatialResearch/MappingForTheUrbanHumanities/blob/master/Tutorials/Images/MakingData01/GeoRef23.png)

Repeat the same steps as used before to select the center of the same intersection from the OSM map and add the locations to the link table:
![blank](https://github.com/CenterForSpatialResearch/MappingForTheUrbanHumanities/blob/master/Tutorials/Images/MakingData01/GeoRef24.png)

You will need to add a minimum of four points to complete the georeferencing (although more is generally better).  Generate at least two more points of your own choosing and add them to the link table.

Be careful to make sure that the control points you add do in fact match.  This can be quite tricky as many of the features have changed or were not actually built as planned.  

Normally it is a good idea to choose control points from throughout the map.  However, in this case this will be difficult as there are few features in the eastern sections of the map that can be reliably associated with contemporary locations.
In this example, I have selected six control points:
![blank](https://github.com/CenterForSpatialResearch/MappingForTheUrbanHumanities/blob/master/Tutorials/Images/MakingData01/GeoRef25.png)

It is good practice to save the table of control points that you are building.  To do this, choose “Save GCP points as” under the file menu and save it in the .points format in the same location as the image. This will allow you to later recreate the work you have done:
![blank](https://github.com/CenterForSpatialResearch/MappingForTheUrbanHumanities/blob/master/Tutorials/Images/MakingData01/GeoRef26.png)

Next, you will “transform” the image and create a georeferenced version of the scanned map image. In the georeferencer window, select transformation settings under the settings window:
![blank](https://github.com/CenterForSpatialResearch/MappingForTheUrbanHumanities/blob/master/Tutorials/Images/MakingData01/GeoRef27.png)

Here you can select the transformation type (Polynomial 1 should be appropriate here), resampling method (Cubic is often used for resampled images and photos), output location and name, and the spatial reference system (here I have selected EPSG:3857, the pseudo Mercator projection used in the OSM data).  You can also opt to have the georeferenced layer added to QGIS when finished: 
![blank](https://github.com/CenterForSpatialResearch/MappingForTheUrbanHumanities/blob/master/Tutorials/Images/MakingData01/GeoRef28.png)

Close the settings options and click on the start georeferencing button ![blank](https://github.com/CenterForSpatialResearch/MappingForTheUrbanHumanities/blob/master/Tutorials/Images/MakingData01/GeoRef29.png).

After the transformation finishes, you should see the map appear in the QGIS workspace:
![blank](https://github.com/CenterForSpatialResearch/MappingForTheUrbanHumanities/blob/master/Tutorials/Images/MakingData01/GeoRef30.png)

You can make the scanned map layer partially transparent in the layer properties.  Right click on the map in the layer panel and select properties:
![blank](https://github.com/CenterForSpatialResearch/MappingForTheUrbanHumanities/blob/master/Tutorials/Images/MakingData01/GeoRef31.png)

On the left panel in the properties dialog, select Transparency, here you can adjust the global transparency with a slider: 
![blank](https://github.com/CenterForSpatialResearch/MappingForTheUrbanHumanities/blob/master/Tutorials/Images/MakingData01/GeoRef32.png)

Compare the georeferenced map with the Open Street Map layer.  Make sure that features appear to match up closely:
![blank](https://github.com/CenterForSpatialResearch/MappingForTheUrbanHumanities/blob/master/Tutorials/Images/MakingData01/GeoRef33.png)

In the next exercise you will be using the sheet you georeferenced here and digitizing some of the features from it.
