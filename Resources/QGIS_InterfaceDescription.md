This is a key to and a brief description of the main elements of the QGIS interface.

1. **The Menu Bar:** This is a standard menu bar that gives you access to many elements of the software. Note that many of the items you can access here can also be accessed through the icons on the toolbars below.
2. **Toolbar:** Gives access to many commonly used tools and features in QGIS. The individual toolbar segments can be moved – hover over the edge of the toolbar until a + icon appears then click and drag the tool bar. Note the location and configuration of the elements of the toolbar on your screen might not match those in this tutorial. Please feel free to move them to which ever configuration is easiest for you to work with. 
		* Note if you ever lose one element of the tool bar you can right click (control + click on Mac) in any empty zone of the toolbar area and a full list of available toolbar elements will appear.
3. **The Map View:** This is where your maps will appear, all layers activated in the layer menu (see item 4) will be visible here. 
4. **Layer menu:** This shows all of the data layers you have added to your current map project. The order of the layers in this menu determines the order in which the layers appear in the map view. The check boxes next to each layer name allows you to turn the visibility of layers on and off. By clicking a specific layer you can access properties for that layer and perform operations on that layer. This is sometimes also referred to as the Map Legend or the Table of Contents. It is not fixed, you can drag the layer menu to occupy a different space on your screen or to take up the full left hand panel.  
5. **Browser:** the browser allows you to access your computer’s file system. You can use this to drag files onto your map project.  Like the layer menu it can be moved to occupy a different space. 
6. **Status Bar:** the status bar shows the position of your cursor in the map view, the current scale and rotation of the map view, and the project’s coordinate system. 

* If you hover over any button in the interface a brief description of that button will appear. additionally if you want a description of a specific element of the interface select the `What’s This?` button circled in blue and click anywhere in the interface for a brief description of that element.
