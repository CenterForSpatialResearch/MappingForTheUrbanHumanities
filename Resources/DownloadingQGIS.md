##Downloading QGIS

The tutorials for *Mapping for the Urban Humanities* are written for QGIS version 2.8 (Wein), thus its best that you download this version of the program. 

###Instructions for PC Users
PC users can download QGIS here and follow the instructions provided by the installer:

* for 32 bit: [QGIS 2.8](http://qgis.org/downloads/QGIS-OSGeo4W-2.8.9-1-Setup-x86.exe)
* for 64 bit: [QGIS 2.8](http://qgis.org/downloads/QGIS-OSGeo4W-2.8.9-1-Setup-x86_64.exe)

(To ditermine whether you are running a 64-bit or Windows look under Start Menu > Control Panel > System)

Follow the prompts on the installer and keep all default settings. 

###Instructions for Mac Users
Mac users must install several packages which support QGIS: GDAL, NumPy, matplotlib, and then QGIS. To avoid any confusion we have included instructions here. 

1. Download this installer: [QGIS 2.8 for Mac](http://www.kyngchaos.com/files/software/qgis/QGIS-2.8.4-1.dmg)

2. Once the download has completed open the QGIS-2.8.4-1.dmg installer. You will see the following:

 You'll notice that the four installer packages included are numbered for the order in which you need to install them. 

3. First select GDAL Complete (circled above). An installer window will open, follow the steps and agree to the terms as prompted. 
 
4. Next install NumPy. Click on the circled icon and again follow the instructions in the installer. Once the NumPy installation is complete do the same with matplotlib, and finally with QGIS. 

5. Once installation is complete QGIS will be in your Applications folder and is now ready to use.
